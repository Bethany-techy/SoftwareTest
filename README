In order for my code and software to be functional and secure, it needs to be tested. This includes testing the code while I am still working on it, testing it again when I am finished. Also by keeping in mind any possible thing that could go work and testing it that way. I use Unit Testing to make sure the code is secure and within the parameters.
By incorporating user needs I would go over the needs of the client and determine importance and how to make those needs a reality within the code
I approach designing it by getting the needs of the client and creating a flowchart of how I want the finish product to look. Then I would go over the steps necessary such as the code that is needed in order to make that end result happen.
